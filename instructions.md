### code/index.html

In `code/index.html`, you'll find we've set up a small amount of code for you. The main things you'll need to focus on are:

```html
<section class="chat" id="chat"></section>
```

This is where the chat messages will be rendered when you add a message as either the bot or the user.

```html
<div class="input-wrapper" id="input-wrapper">
  <form id="name-form">
    <label for="name-input">Name</label>
    <input id="name-input" type="text" />
    <button class="send-btn" type="submit">Send</button>
  </form>
</div>
```

This is where you can show input elements to the user - text inputs, buttons, selects, etc. We have started with a form with an input and a button so that the user can write their name as the answer to the first question of our bot, but as you present new questions, you'll need to select this `.input-wrapper` div and replace its content with your new inputs.

### code/index.js

Next up, in `code/script.js`, we've prepared the initial code to make the bot ask the 'what's your name' question.

The `showMessage` function takes two arguments - the message, and the sender. You can pass any text as the message and either 'user' or 'bot' as the sender. Depending on which sender you choose, it'll build up some HTML and append it to the 'chat' div with a different image and class name.

The `greetUser` function sends a message as the bot asking for your name.

Then, at the bottom, we use `setTimeout` to make the browser invoke the `greetUser` function after 1 second (1000ms)

You can see the `showMessage` function in action. Open up `code/index.html` in Chrome and open up the console panel of the developer tools. In the console, you can invoke this `sendMessage` function yourself. Type the following (and hit the return key to finish) to send a message as the bot:

```jsx
showMessage("Hey there, I'm a bot", "bot");
```

You should now see a new message in the list. ðŸ™Œ Now try sending a message as the user:

```jsx
showMessage("I am totally human", "user");
```

**Awesome**. Now it's time to start writing some code!

# Steps

### Step 1 - Try out what's already there

The `greetUser` function sends a message as the bot asking for your name. This is the "start" of the bot.

Right now that function is being invoked when you load the webpage, _but_ with a delay of one second. `setTimeout(greeting, 1000)`

Try to change this to make the greeting appear faster and slower.

The `showMessage` function takes two arguments - the message, and the sender. You can pass any text as the message and either 'user' or 'bot' as the sender. This is handled with conditionals.

Try to add a `console.log` in the if statement to practise using the console.

```jsx
} else if (sender === 'bot') {
		// add a console.log here to see when it's being logged and not

    chat.innerHTML += `
      <section class="bot-msg">
        <img src="assets/bot.png" alt="Bot" />
        <div class="bubble bot-bubble">
          <p>${message}</p>
        </div>
      </section>
    `
  }
```

Also try to understand what is happening in the `<p>` tag above. what happens if you remove the `$` and the curly brackets around `message`?

When you feel like you understand the code and have added the console.logs, commit and push those changes to GitHub. Remember to write short but descriptive commit messages.

### Step 2 - Have it your way ðŸ‘‹

Now it's time to plan and make a decision about what kind of bot you want to build. Put a name to the bot in the HTML. As a default the bot will greet you with _"Hello there, What's your name?"_ Make sure to change this to whatever you want your bot to say.

Also think about **when** you want the greeting to happen. Maybe instead of invoking it when the website loads, you want to invoke the greeting function with a button? That's up to you.

Again, commit and push your changes.

### Step 3 - Get the party started ðŸª©

The chatbot isn't that fun if you can't interact with it. Get the first user answer to appear and get the conversation with the bot started.

In the starter code, the first event is asking for the user's name. The starter code asks the first question from the bot, and we've got the input field in the page ready for the user to type their name. So the first task is to listen to the form being submitted, (by clicking send or hitting the enter key), and to react to it.

**We want to:**

1. Listen for the form submit event
2. When the form is submitted, post the value from the text input as a message from the user
3. Progress the app to the next question.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Remember to create small functions for different parts of your bot. This is a hint to one way of dealing with the first user input ðŸ‘‡ If you changed the first question to something else than asking for a name, you should name the function that handles that input accordingly.

</aside>

```jsx
const handleNameInput = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  // Store the value in a variable so we can access it after we
  // clear it from the input
  const name = nameInput.value;
  showMessage(name, "user");
  nameInput.value = "";

  // After 1 second, show the next question by invoking the next function.
  // passing the name into it to have access to the user's name if we want
  // to use it in the next question from the bot.
  setTimeout(() => showFoodOptions(name), 1000);
};
```

Commit and push your changes.

### Step 4 - Convo is key ðŸ’¬

Now you have a solid base for your bot, and the beginnings of a control flow from questions and answers, it's just to keep building up your event functions which then invoke the next question function, and to figure out the flow of your code.

Have you thought about the conversation yet? What kind of questions and answers do you want to have? Will it be typed in inputs? Yes or no with pressing buttons? A dropdown list to select from? A mix of everything? That's up to you.

Add a few more questions and answers to your bot.

Commit and push your changes.

### Step 5 - If I say potato, you say...? ðŸ¥”

We want you to practice conditionals, so it's time to add some if...else statements to your bot. For example, if the user types an invalid answer they should be prompted with a message that says: _"That's not a valid answer"_ or something similar.

Check our live example bot and try out a few different answers to see the differences you get in the replies from the bot.

## Stretch Goals

So youâ€™ve completed all the steps above? Great job! Make sure you've committed and pushed a version of your project before starting on the stretch goals. Remember that the stretch goals are optional.

### Intermediate Stretch Goals

- Work on your CSS skills, and change the styling.
- How is the user answering the questions? Choose the form elements that you think fit the purpose best.

### Advanced Stretch Goals
- Add sound effects to the chat.
- Refactor the code to learn more about different approaches with functions
  - Hint:
  In the examples above, we have made it where each function knows which is the next function to load (so in `handleNameInput`, it calls `showFoodOptions` as it knows this is the next step in the flow). This is ok, and is just one of many approaches you could choose to take here.

  Another option is to make a more generic `askNextQuestion` function which keeps track of the current question and then invokes other functions based on what is next. This is a better approach as the project grows and you potentially have many steps, but it can be more complicated to start with as it means you have to think abstractly from the beginning.

  A good idea is to get everything working with the more explicit approach of one answer handler calling the next question function, before refactoring your code to abstract things and make it easier to add more questions.
- Use setTimeout() to show the user that the bot is processing/loading/typing if you choose to use setTimeout() for all the bot's answers
