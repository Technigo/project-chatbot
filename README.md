# Project Name

This project was to build a chat bot using HTML and Javascript. 

## The problem
We were given the base code in HTML and CSS and needed to mostly work in Javascript to get the chat bot going. 
First I linked all the elements of the HTML with the JS in the DOM section and then tried to get a  very simple chat bot going. I planned more complicated elements but could not achieve them with my level of knowledge and time given. I would have liked the boring vacation button to loop the chat back to the beginning somehow and also to have a dropdown menu of some kind.
