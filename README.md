# Javascrip Chatbot

Technigo BootCamp: Week 1 | Chatbot. <br><br>This week we will be building a chatbot. <br>The focus is to practice the JavaScript parts listed below, but also to hook it up with the HTML.

-> How to use variables in JavaScript.

-> How to use conditionals in JavaScript.

-> Know some string methods to modify strings.

-> Understand control flow and the use of conditional statements.

-> How to use functions in JavaScript

-> Different datatypes

## The problem

I was studying multiple example chatbots and generating ideas for my own bot. 
Then i planned the different choices/answers/questions and where them will lead the user.
<br>If I had more time I would try to implement some more styling and a better "end" to the conversation.
