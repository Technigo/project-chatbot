# Mood bot
The assignement was to create a chat bot. The focus was to try JavaScript and also connecting it to HTML.

## The problem
We used stack overflow to answer our questions and also used the help example from the assignement. We used object to solve the issue of local variables. 

If we had a bit more time we would have made more changes to the css.
