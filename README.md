# Beauty studio chat bot

This project of a Chat-bot, was made as a Week 4 project for Technigo bootcamp. Made by me and Camilla.

The aim of this project was to create a Chat-bot, work on it in pairs (pair-programming), learn how and where to use variables in JavaScript, different datatypes, use conditionals and functions.

## The problem

All the new knowlege about JavaScript that was learnt over week 4 was used for building this chat-bot.
