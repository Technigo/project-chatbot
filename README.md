# Project Name
Week 4 project was to create a chatbot using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Lisen and i made a "Fika chat-bot" for ordering  fika.

## The problem
We struggled how to trigger the chat bot question and make it go to the next question. We read stack overflow and asked the team.
If we have more time we would make chat sound and some animation.
