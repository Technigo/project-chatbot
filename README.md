# Project Name

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

Pair programming where we built a chatbot with Javascript. Our bot is called The Beat Bot and gives you song recommendations based on your mood. When choosing a song in the dropdown list it plays for you directly in the browser.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

We used HTML, CSS and Javascript. In Javascript we worked with conditionals such as if else statements, changing the inner.HTML as well as different methods. Our planning were to start with what we wanted our bot to do. We began with having a start button and there after created functions with drop down lists and buttons. We also used the same approach as we had with last weeks accordion to implement so that the chat window could collapse and expand at the bottom of the page.

We got stuck sometimes and if we could do this all over again we would plan for more breaks to get new energy to keep going. We pushed ourselves a bit hard some evenings which made us really tired. But in over all we are very proud in how everything turned out.

OBS! It is not possible to play the music in Safari browsers or on smartphones due to autoplay block. Works best in Chrome :)
