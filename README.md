# Project chatbot

A chatbot designed to help the user orther food .

## The problem

The main problem was to put all the new learning things join up together.
This was our first week learning JS, and the project was overwhelming in many senses, but it was a good exercise to grasp some of the basic concepts of JS: the DOM, selectors, creating functions, scopes, event listeners, and more.

With more time, I would have played more with the style and added sounds, cleaned up the code, and trying to understand every thing more among many other things.

I started the project with Manuela, but after not having time to work at the same time, we finished separately.
