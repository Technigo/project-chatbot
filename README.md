# MirelaÂ´s Chatbot

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem

## Step 1: 
//Console.log
Did not manage to use the console.log directly in the browser - got errors. It works in the code, and I think I am getting the hang of it, even though I am not sure if I have fully understood the benefits and possibilities of the console.log. Therefore, I decided to mirror the chat log in the console for this project.

## Step 2: 
//Start Chat:
I wanted to start the chat throught a button, but found this too complicated and time consuming while I was working on this step. Did not have the time to go back to it after getting more of a hang on buttons. I hope we can learn this at a later point. 

## Step 3: 
//Show the response from user:
I found the next part hard - I did not find the example in the read.me instructions very helpful as it did not work no matter what I tried. I found a thread about this topic in slack, so I did the same, which included the userName = nameInput.value part within this function. Not sure why this works and other things I tried do not.

//Send message back 
I found this part a bit easier, however it took time to figure out where to put the message delay. It was not logical to me that it should be under the users reply, but I saw an example code on a slack thread and tried it - it worked! I tested having bot messages pop up with a few seconds between them. 

## Step 4: 
- buttons
