# Project Name

The assignment is to create a chat bot. I chose to create a chat bot for a restaurant where you can order food. 

## The problem
The problems I had was to get the buttons and options right,  to understand the flow of the functions and the scroll to bottom is not working through the whole conversation which I haven't been able to fix yet.
Stack overflow helped me alot with this project and I'm happy that I'm not alone. 
If I had more time I would include alternatives for drinks as well and experiment with sounds on submit.
