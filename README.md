# Project Name

I thought this weeks assignment was really funny. Got inspired by valentines day this week and had to somehow get that vibe into my project.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I struggled with structuring the code as suggested with DOM selectors, functions and eventlisteners. My buttons are eventlisteners as they also have functions to them I couldn't place them in that order and make the code work. Other than that I think I defined functions for different tasks such as displaying messages, handling user inputs, and generating date ideas based on user preferences.

If I had more time I would have added a typewriter effect to the chat. I didn't know where in the code to place it and get it to work. Definetly would have played around with effects, animations or even add some kind of chat sound.
