# Project Name

The project was to build a chatbot using javascript. This was the first pairprogramming assignment (Karoline Mann and Birgit Nehrwein). We decided to build a chatbot for a pet grooming company.

## The problem

We started by doing a flowchart to visualize the conversation flow between the bot and the user. After that we started to work with the given starter code in Javascript following the iterations in the project brief guidelines.
In the js code we worked with 
- DOM selectors
- global variables
- functions
- eventhandlers
- conditional statements

If we would have more time we would get more elaborated on the styling and responsivness.
