# Project Name

The second project of the Javascript sprint was to create a chat bot using functions, DOM selectors and conditionals. 

## The problem

I had a hard time getting started with this. I understand the overall logic but found it difficult to put everything in place. The most difficult part was to put together the ask question function and getting it to check correct answer. I needed a lot of help from chat gpt for that, also with the final score function. I also found it hard with the order of things and getting each step to work. 

I also watched the videos about DOMs and functions again to try to understand the whole concept and putting it together but I must say that I still am somewhat confused and need to read more about this. 

If I had more time I would add a function to restart the quiz. I would also add some sounds since it is a music quiz, that could be fun.
