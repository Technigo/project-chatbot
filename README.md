# Project Name

This weekâ€™s project was to build a Chat Bot. The focus has been to practice JavaScript and hook it up with HTML. We have done this project in a pair, Suki Nhung Phan and Mimmi Fordal Uddin.

## The problem

We first made a plan on figma, choosing a theme, and deciding how to structure the bot. Then we did Iteration 1-6 before we started building our project. We planned the bot a little different from the technigo one and made some changes to make it our version. 

How did we make it different?

 - We decided to develop the user's answers in a more unique way by adding customised next questions, instead of having them repeating (basing on Technigo's example). At the same time, our end goal was to follow Technigo's instruction and leverage the if/else statement to solve the problem
 
 - Next, we added media queries to make the site responsive, as the raw code was only writen for desktop version.  It was challenging to look at the other's code and make changes. We took advantage of using the browser inspector and going through every single detail such as font-size, button, margin, padding, and so on. As the result, we are happy with how our chat bot looks like now. 



## What would you do, if you could have more time?

If there were more time, we would add more dialogue options to make it more realistic.
