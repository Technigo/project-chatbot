# Project Name

KittenBot - a bot the helps you build a kitten!

## The problem

I had this thing working pretty well and then i decided to add the possibility for the user to request a new name suggestion for the kitten. That turned out to be a really bad idea, because... well i think i tried to incorporate pretty complex functionality without really adjusting the structure of the code to make it work. Also, i don't really know what the heck i am doing, so there is that. But i decided to submit anyway before 00.00 so i can get a code review. Will probably try to fix the last bits after.
