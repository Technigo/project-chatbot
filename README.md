# Project Chatbot

The task was to extend the code in a chatbot. To create an interaction between user and bot.

## The problem

It was quite quick to start coding. The problems for me came later in the code when conditional statements were to be implemented.
As usual, it was an exercise in trial and error for me. Searched google for code solutions. Couldn't get it to work. Searched for new code solutions. Then I tried to get help from a well-known AI bot. Spent way too much time implementing the answers I got from there. But finally the code works reasonably well. Nothing remarkable and without any cool features.
