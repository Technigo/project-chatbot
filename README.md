# Project Name

The assignment was to build a chat bot, working together in a pair and pair-programming.


## The problem
We started out making a schedule for the upcoming week of then we could sit down together, pair-programming. We started out programming without a clear structure of how to build the bot its functions. We soon had an ambition of a more intricate question-structure, nesting the if else statements. We soon realized the difficulties in the attempted structure and went over to writing a flatter most simplistic structure where question and answer werenâ€™t nested. If we had more time we would have added more functions and more styling. Throughout the project, time-management have been a challenge and in terms of JavaScript, learning by doing has been interesting ang challenging.
