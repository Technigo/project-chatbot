# ChatBot Project - Pizzaria Technigo

Welcome to the Pizzaria Technigo ChatBot project. This chatbot is designed to assist users in placing pizza orders from Pizzaria Technigo. It provides a user-friendly interface to select pizza options, choose subtypes, specify the order type (child or adult), and confirm the order.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to create a chatbot that streamlines the pizza ordering process. Users can interact with the bot to place orders, select pizza types, specify preferences, and receive confirmation.

## Approach

To tackle this project, we utilized the following approach and technologies:

- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: We used these core web technologies to create the chatbot's user interface and interactivity.

- **User Greeting**: The chatbot greets the user and initiates the conversation.

- **User Messages**: Users can send messages and instructions to the chatbot via an input field.

- **Bot Responses**: The chatbot processes user messages, understands the intent, and generates appropriate responses.

- **Order Workflow**: The chatbot guides users through an order workflow, allowing them to select pizza types (pizza, pasta, salad), subtypes, specify if it's for a child or adult, and confirm the order.

- **Deployment**: The project can be viewed live [here](https://stenlisuryadinata.github.io/project-chatbot/code/index.html).
