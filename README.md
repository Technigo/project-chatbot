# Chatbot with Javascript

The first week of the Technigo bootcamp, our task was to build a chatbot with vanilla JS. We got a starter code with some basic styling and some functions to get started with. We worked individually this week.

## The brief

This week we will be building a chatbot. The focus is to practice the JavaScript parts, but also to hook it up with the HTML. Your Chatbot could be about whatever you want. A Peptalk-Bot, a Food Ordering-Bot, a Joking-Bot?  Here is a little example that you can be inspired by: https://technigo-chatbot.netlify.app/
