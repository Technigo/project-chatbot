# Project chatbot

This project main concern is to learn more about DOM, functions and scope in js. To practice this I created a chatbot. 
This chatbot wants to learn you some Danish words!

## The problem

Firstly I looked at other people's code and chatbots to find some inspiration to what I wanted to do. Then I tried with the code we recieved from the start and from there with help from my team, google, chat gpt and the material on notion I managed to build the code.
If I hade more time I would:
- Add a soundfile would be fun but felt a bit overwhelming for now.
- Add a function that creates a validation rule that you only can pick one word and then it's removed but at the same time I think it's nice if you want to "learn" the word again during one learning session. Or maybe add a function that limits how many times you can use the loop.
