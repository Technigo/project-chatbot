# Week 4 - Satanic Ex Chatbot

The assignment was to create a chatbot with user inputs and a conversation tree using functions and conditionals, by iterations in pair programming.

## The problem

We started with the concept of the chatbot, and sketched the design in Figma.

Besides building the HTML and CSS, we didn't plan the JavaScript aspect - instead we focused on how we wanted the conversation to go. Then we tried (many times) to get the Javascript to do what we wanted it to. This meant a lot of testing and breaking, trial and error.

We first got the ball rolling / unstuck after Friday, when we got some more inspiration from our team demo, as well as the live session with Karin, on how to solve our JS issues.

If we had more time, we would like to add more steps in the conversation, as well as cleaning up the exname input like we did with the user login name. We would also like to refactor both our Javascript and CSS, because it is a bit of a (beautiful) Frankenstein.
