# Project Name

I thought this weeks assignment was really funny. Got inspired by valentines day this week and had to somehow get that vibe into my project.

## The problem

I struggled with structuring the code as suggested with DOM selectors, functions and eventlisteners. My buttons are eventlisteners as they also have functions to them I couldn't place them in that order and make the code work. Other than that I think I defined functions for different tasks such as displaying messages, handling user inputs, and generating date ideas based on user preferences.

If I had more time I would have added a typewriter effect to the chat. I didn't know where in the code to place it and get it to work. Definetly would have played around with effects, animations or even add some kind of chat sound.
