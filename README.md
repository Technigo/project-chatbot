# Week 1: Bob the C(h)atbot

During the first week of the Technigo web development bootcamp, the task was to build a chatbot with vanilla JS. We worked individually on this project.
## The brief

The focus was to practice the JavaScript parts, using setTimeout, eventListeners and if/else statements to build a control flow. But also to hook it up with the HTML. The bot could be about whatever we wanted. I chose to go for a chatbot without the "h", a catbot called Bob that acts like a cat when you interact with it.
