# Project - Mai&Wen's pizzeria

We created this chaatbot using Javascript, CSS and HTML. We make the bot ask follow-up questions and provide the options for users to choose from. Techinical side, we used setTimeout function to set the delays and callback functions. Moreover we streamlined the flow by using nested functions and for-loop.

## The problem

The challenge was not only to create an interactive chatbot that can engage users in a conversation and provide responses accordingly but also to write the clean and maintainable code.
Eash step of the conversation was put into its own separate function. A flowchat was drafted to visualize the converstion flow to understand how different parts of the chatbot would interact.
