# Project Name

Catering Chatbot
This project is for ordering food by a chatbot. We serve pizza, salad and pasta.

## The problem

First, we did a flow chart to sketch out the flow.
We worked one function at a time, trying to keep them to only one task each. This to make the code readable but also give us the ability to easily recall a function if needed.
We had some issues creating elements and attaching eventlisteners, and settled on a quite static approach with one listener for each clickable element.

Next step would be rafactoring to make the code more dynamic. Also, we kept all the original css and html.
