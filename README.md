# Project Name

A chat-bot for the Week 1 Sprint for Technigo.

Exercise in, among other things, using if-clauses.

Decided to make the actual function of my chatbot very light-hearted, and instead focusing on coding it.

## The problem

I had some trouble refactoring, but I looked at some old code which gave me inspiration for the stepThroughQuestions-function. In the future I would probably make it another way, maybe with a nextQuestion string which refers to a question for the bot. That way you could step back and skip steps in an easier way.
