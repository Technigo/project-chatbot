# Chatbot

This week we will be building a chatbot. The focus is to practice the JavaScript parts, but also to hook it up with the HTML. Your Chatbot could be about whatever you want.

## The problem

How did you plan?
I dedicated the beginning of the week to study all the materials, going over it 1-2 times and end of the week to write the actual code.

What technologies did you use?
Slack, Stack Overflow, Youtube, Jitsi with team-mates

If you had more time, what would be next?
Add more functions to the conversation, I tried in many different ways to add a function that would show the adress of the restaurant the user selected but I din't figure it out.
