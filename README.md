# Project Chatbot
## Introduction

This repository contains the code for a boba shop bot, my interactive chatbot project. I designed this chatbot to help customers personalize their boba tea orders. With this bot, users can choose their tea base, toppings, and drink size, and receive an order confirmation.

## Steps
To create the bot, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Here's how I approached the project:
HTML Structure: Was provided by Technigo
CSS: I updated the styling to fit my project as well as updating the responsive design.
JavaScript Logic: I implemented JavaScript to handle user interactions, process selections, and to generate responses.
Audio Feedback: I added audio notifications to enhance the user experience and provide feedback.
User Interaction: Users can engage with the bot by selecting options presented through buttons and dropdown menus.
Order Calculation: I programmed the bot to calculate the total order price based on user choices.
