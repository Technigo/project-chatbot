# Valentine's Chatbot

This weeks project was to make a chatbot with focus on DOM and functions.The user was supposed to place an order, the bot respond to the user input. We worked in theams of 2, this project was made by Alma Hellström and Izabel Lind Färnstrand. 

## The problem

We solved the problem by creating functions handling the different types of user input. The functions were triggered by event listeners listening for clicks on the order buttons. We planned the program by discussing how we wanted the order to flow. If we had more time, we would have refactored the code to make it cleaner, lighter and easier to follow, as it got quite long and heavy with plenty of if statements.
