# Project Name

I used conditional statements and the prompt() method as was recommended to interact with the user and gather their preferences. I planned the program's structure by breaking it down into steps, such as asking for the type of food, subtype, and portion size, and handling user input validation. Instead of asking for the user's age I wanted to make the user were able to pick a portion size (because that's what I would have wanted).

## The problem
 If I had more time, I would improve the user interface to make it more intuitive and enhance error handling for invalid inputs.
