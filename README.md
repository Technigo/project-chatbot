Chatbot project


The goal was to make a chatbot with a partner, in the pair-programming modality.

the problem

We struggled with the logical order of the function and the implementation of the schema that we had planned. our strategy was to stick to the code that we could understand and not try more advanced things that we didn't know how to make work. If we had more time, we would add more options using conditionals, try to fix the responses timing and the overall styling.
