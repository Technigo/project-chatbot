# Project Chatbot Party Closet

This is a project from the Technigo Bootcamp, made by Siri Hemsley and Yennie Leek.

The assigment was to create a chatbot with different interactions and conversations, depending on the answer from the user. 

## The problem

This was our first real JavaScript project and we spend the first half of the week just trying to understand the assignment and how to structure our code. 

After looking at both the structure that Maks showed on the Wednesday lecture, and the structure that the example bot had, we decided that the latter was more appropriate for our bot. And to us that one was more easy to understand and follow. 

We used that script as a guide to create our code structure and then added our own features to suit the bot. 

We used a Miro flow chart to draw up the conversation and all the different questions and possible answers and used that as a guide. We googled a lot and found helpful articles of W3Schools and StackOverflow where we also asked for help. 

## If you had more time, what would be next?
- We would extend the bot with more questions and answers and more interactions. 
- We wanted to also include the bot typing visuals before the message appear, but did not have time. 
- We wanted to style the dropdown menu options, but realised to do this we had to completely create a new one using unordered list and script function.
