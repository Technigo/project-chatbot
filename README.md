# Project Chatbot

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.
An project meant to teach how to manipulate the DOM by creating a chatbot that does various things.

## The problem

I approached the project with a chatbot mindset, as in a chatbox that displays messages from both the bot and the user.
Initially I had no idea where to start, so I read up on the DOM and DOM manipulation but didn't feel like that was enough. So I started watching videos about chatbots and asking chatGPT in order to gain a better understanding of how to implement different features. Something that bothered me early on was the chat resetting every time a message was sent, but that was solved when I realized what the problem actually was.
I am not quite sure if the soundclip I used is okay to use or not, please let me know if it isn't and I will remove it.
If I would've had more time, I probably would have played around with the CSS more and added more replies to increase the bot interaction.
As of right now, it only responds to a few messages or handles orders by pressing the "Place an Order"-button.
