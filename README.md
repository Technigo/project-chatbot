# Project Name

Pizza Chat Bot

This project involves creating a chat bot that assists users in ordering a pizza by asking a series of questions.

## The problem

The main challenge was to manage the state of the conversation and handle user inputs appropriately. The approach was to use a state machine concept where the chat bot's behavior is determined by its current state (e.g., asking for the user's name, asking for the type of pizza, etc.).
