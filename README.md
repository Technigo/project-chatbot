# Week 4: chatbot

We had this week to build a chat-bot in order to practice JavaScript and pair-programming.

## The problem

We started by planning the main questions to figure out the flow of our chat-bot. For the coding [add something here to describe how we did]

If we had more time, we would maybe restructure our JavaScript file in a more efficient way since we repeat ourselves a little bit. The next weeks will help us to have a better understanding of JavaScript and to feel more comfortable of moving the code around.
