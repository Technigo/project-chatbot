# Project Name

A chatbot designed for ordering food.

## The problem

The main problem was to apply a function for each of the subDishOptions which would lead to the order confirmation.
we append subdish options to inputWrapper
use the even listener to interact on click
and finally added a function to handle subdish selection

With more time, we would ahve played more with the style.
