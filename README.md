# Project Name
The assigment was to create a functional chatbot using Javascript, HTML and CSS. I've made a pizzeria called "Elina's daily surprise pizzeria".


## The problem
I've struggled alot this week. I've found it very hard to make sense out of the starter code and how to add the right code in general. I tried making buttons and select options but I could never make it work. Therefor I approached the different steps in another way than I think we were suppose to. I kept looking at the videos on disco but for me it was very hard to apply the content to this weeks assigment. Since I didn't figure out how to make buttons and select options I did a simple version of the chatbot. The customer can't pick the type of pizza, pasta or salad only the food type, hence the "Daily Surprise" solution. Tools I used were chatgbpt, stack overflow, the material on disco and google.
