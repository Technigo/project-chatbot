# Project Name

Task was to build a chatbot. The focus was to practice the JavaScript parts, but also to hook it up with the HTML and css.

Project build by Mia Dahlgren & Julia Ã–stedt

## The problem

We planned our project with a Figma-board creating a flow chart and mapping out our ideas. Decided to start with a basic function and add on more as we went along.
We spent quite some time on understanding the connection between the javascript and HTML which cleared up as we progressed.
We struggled to create links in our chat-messages but through some research and stackoverflow help we learnt that a basic a-tag was the solution.

If we had more time, we would have added more chat-interactions and something to show the user that the bot is processing it's answer.
