# Project Chatbot

This project is part of the Technigo bootcamp autumn 2021, the goal was to learn pair programming and javascript in the form of a chatbot. The Star Wars LEGO shop is a chatbot that acompanies the customer through the process of buying a gift in form of Star Wars Lego.

## The problem

The template from Technigo was a styled chatbot that showed a greeting message, we started by getting the message printout logic working for the user. Then we brainestormed a flow of questions and possible user routes through the chat. Each question from the bot is accompanied by somekind of user input in the bottom of the chat.

The site is build with HTML, CSS, JS. The top has a the title and the chat is a scrollable view with all the messages that appear.
