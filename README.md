# Project Chat-bot
My assignment was to create a chat-bot that interacts with the user. The bot asks for the users name and engages in conversation were the user chooses a treat and has the opportunity to choose a beverage.

## The problem
During the development of the chatbot, I encountered several challenges. One of the biggest issues was handling the users input correctly and making sure that the chatbot responded when I wanted it to during each stage of the converstation. I also struggled with keeping track of the different stages of the conversation, such as when the bot asks for the users name, choice of treat, and then beverage. I quickly noticed the importance of structuring the code in a clear way to make sure that everything works correctly and so that I can easily make changes that are required. It was also a challange to manage the local and the global variables to remember the users choice. Next time I will organize my code already from start and make sure to write the code as clean as possible a and use comments and choose suitable variable names and function names.
