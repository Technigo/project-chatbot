# Project Name

Pair project for making a chatbot in JavaScript, using variables, functions, string methods, conditionals and return values.

## The problem

Started by watching some examples of chatbots and trying to figure out what the bot should chat about. During the dummy content phase it became a bartender bot with the idea to serve some virtual drink.
The plan evolved during the iterations, made some changes along the way.
Tried to add as much variety as possible technology wise for learning purposes, like added images and sound.

If there was more time adding more dialogue options and more techniques would be focused.
