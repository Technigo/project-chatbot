# Project Name

The project breif was to build a chatbot with JS, using variable, functions and conditionals. 

## The problem

We sat together in our pair and coded most of the time and we also joined our other teammembers
to learn more. We got stuck multiple times and what we did was search for the answers online, 
we asked a question in stackOverflow and if we really couldn't solve it we asked for help from
teammembers  our private network. We especially got stuck with trying to make the conversation
certain order, how to add a link in the chat and with if else statements.

If we had more time we would add a dropdown input and a sound to the bot answers. We would also
use inner.HTML for the buttons instead of putting them in the HTML. We would also style it more.
