# Project Name

My chatbot project is a virtual coffee shop called "Hot Java Coffee", where the lovely virtual coffee assistant Cuppa is in your service for all your coffee needs.

## The problem

At first I struggled a lot with this project. It was difficult to get properly started and my head just felt completely empty and I didn't know what to do. I did eventually get into the swing of it and managed to make a cute little project. It's not everything I wanted; some things I tried to make work for hours on end were eventually just scrapped (like a properly working drop-down menu or disappearing buttons) and I stuck to the stuff I managed to make work, like the buttons which (after finally being able to make them work) appear multiple times in my bot. Even though I wish I could've made it more elaborate, I'm still pretty happy with the result as this one really tested my brain.
