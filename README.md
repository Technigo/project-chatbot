# DJ Bot 

We developed a music bot which  asks your mode and offers a song depending on its own mode ðŸ‘¾ 

## The problem

This project was done in pairs. And we experienced pair programming for the first time. 

The main target was to practicing DOM, conditionals, functions and variables. 

We proceeded according to the given iterations. The first step was adding a start button to activate the greeting. After the users first input, we proceeded to the next questions in turn.
It changes the background color depending on the users input and offers alternative music styles. At the end of the conversation, it plays a song. When we finished the structure then we styled it.

We wanted to keep it simple so we wouldnâ€™t get confused at the beginning of our js learning.  
If we had more time, probably the bot could have a better logical conversation with more functions.
