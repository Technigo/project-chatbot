# Project Name

The task was to create an interactive chatbot.

## The problem

Initially, I had trouble getting the JavaScript file to function correctly in the HTML file. Another challenge was managing the flow of user interactions, specifically making sure that the bot stopped responding when the user chose "No" for ordering food. I used JavaScript techniques such as conditionals and functions to address these issues. If I had more time, I would refine the conversation logic and add more complex food ordering options.

I struggled with adding line breaks in the chatbot's responses. I attempted different methods, but only the old <br> tag worked.
