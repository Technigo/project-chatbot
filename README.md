# Project Name

We had an assignment to make a bot who is asking the user some questions. There should be different input types.

## The problem

I started by testing the code who was already in the script.js file. Than I started adding the questions with the help of functions. In the end I tried to brush up my code by putting all the Dom selectors and global variables to the top and therefore make the code more readable.
