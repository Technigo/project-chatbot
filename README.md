# Project Name

Our project is based on dating sites, but instead of dating with people, user gets to date with a book. Our chatbot is called LOVELITS for those who crave surprise in their life. 

The assignment is to create a chatbot and to have an understanding of basic JavaScript with functions, variables, and statement. 

## The problem

Overall, we had problems with the real basic of JavaScript like what everything is. We managed to solve our problems by asking questions, browsing answers from Google, and inspecting codes from other websites, and just experiment with our knowledge.
