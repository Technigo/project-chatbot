# Boredom Buddy Bot

This chatbot engages users in a fun, interactive conversation by asking questions about their preferences, habits, and personality, with a feedback option at the end.

## The problem

The challenge was to create an engaging chatbot using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that interacts naturally with users through buttons. The project involved building a conversation flow that responded dynamically to user inputs.
The hardest I struggled with was firstly the setup of the design, I already had an idea what I wanted to do for the bot but the input and button took way more out of me than I anticipated. Secondly was hard to actually get the functions running, eventhough everything was written out, I was firstly confused when to save the variable, in which function to replace the newly built function etc. Overall challenging but doable!
