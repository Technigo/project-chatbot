# Project Name

The task was to create a chatbot using mainly javascript.

## The problem

First of all I thought the task was simply difficult. It didn't get better of the fact that I was sick and had a fever all week. So this is why I am leaving it so late, and why it's so... simple. I just want to leave anything :)
