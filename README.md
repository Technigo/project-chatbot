#chatbot
This weeks project was to build a chatbot, to practise JavaScript and connection to HTML.

##The problem
By using course information, videos and exercises in code pen we created the chatbox. We started off by choosing theme and content for the chatbot, then created the code and last did some styling in css. To get the chatbot to replay, moving on to the next question. We solved it by watching the lectures, taking inspo from other chatbot, and trail and error. We also had trouble synching our scheduels, but we had great communication, and showed eachother what we did, so both understood.
