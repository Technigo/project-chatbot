# Sunny Destination Chatbot

### Week 1 Technigo Bootcamp 
This project was to build a chat bot using HTML and Javascript. The idea was to begin to understand variables, conditionals and functionals in Javascript as well as understanding the control flow of conditional statments.  

## The problem
We were given a base code with basic HTML and CSS and needed to mostly work in Javascript to get the chat bot going. 

First I linked all the elements of the HTML with the JS and tried to get a very simple chat bot going that identifies a user and offers suggustions of travel destinations. After I had the simple bot I styled it with CSS. <br> I planned more complicated elements but could not achieve them with my level of knowledge and time given. For example, I would have liked the boring vacation button to loop the chat back to the beginning somehow and also to have a dropdown menu of some kind.
