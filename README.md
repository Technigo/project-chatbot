# Project Name - Count with Ruth (r√§kna med Rut)

Practice parts of JavaScript we've learnt so far by creating a chat bot!

## The problem

The objectives were
- Be comfortable using variables
- Know some string methods to modify strings
- Understand control flow and the use of conditionals statements
- Be able to write basic functions which take arguments and return values
- Connect the JavaScript to show visual feedback in the HTML

Our approach
We sourced a lot of information from code alongs, prerecorded materails, live bot example and perhaps most important, our team. Generally we all had our different struggles and ambitions with the project but I think only a scarce few of us would have made it through the week without the support and assistance of eachother.

Our main obstacle was to set an conditional statement that allowed us to move from a-b considering the users input. We had a bisic idea/understanding but our initial approch tried to mix too much of the above named sources and only after some time and a team session were we able to put toghether a functional bot.

We made minor changes to css in order to allow more space for content in each bubble since our convo was rather lenghty from bots part - it looked nicer in our opinion.
