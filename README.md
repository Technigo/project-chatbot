# The Semla Bot

In this week's assignment we created a chatbot using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, focusing on using functions and understanding the communication flow of the chatbot vs. user. 

We implemented mob programming for this project. 


## The problem


In the beginning it was challenging to understand the structure of the code base but we broke it down to smaller tasks and discussed and added comments to clarify each step and tested different ways to approach each problem, aswell as using the console to clarify that data was in the right place. 


It was challenging to add eventlisteners to multiple radio buttons but we used a loop to go through each element to be able to define the value of each invididual radio button.
