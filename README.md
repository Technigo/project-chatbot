# Project Name

Create an interactive chatbot using basic JavaScript.

## The problem

The problem is approached by creating a chatbot interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The chatbot engages in a conversation with the user by displaying messages in a chat window. It starts with a greeting message and asks questions about plants, providing facts and care tips based on the user's responses. The chatbot uses event listeners and timeouts to control the flow of the conversation.

Tools and Techniques Used:
HTML/CSS: Used for creating the chat interface and styling.
JavaScript: Used to implement dynamic behavior, including message display, user input handling, and conditional responses.
DOM Manipulation: Utilized to create, modify, and remove elements in the chat interface.

Given more time, several improvements could be made to enhance the chatbot:
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Implementing NLP capabilities to enable more natural and context-aware conversations.
2. Error Handling: Adding error handling mechanisms to manage unexpected user inputs or conversation flow issues.
3. Accessibility: Ensuring accessibility for users with disabilities.
4. User Experience: Improving user experience with smoother transitions and animations.
