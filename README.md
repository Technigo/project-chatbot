# Project Chatbot
In the first week of Technigo web development bootcamp, the task was to create a chatbot, and in doing so practice basic Javascript concepts and syntaxes. 

The goal this week was to begin learning the following:

✓ How to use variables in JavaScript.

✓ How to use conditionals in JavaScript.

✓ Know some string methods to modify strings.

✓ Understand control flow and the use of conditional statements.

✓ How to use functions in JavaScript

✓ Different datatypes



For my project, I created a chatbot for an imaginary hair salon, where you can book an appointment, but also get information on opening hours or random style advice.

## The problem
I began creating the basic functionality, practicing the concepts of functions, eventlisteners and different variables in small fractions. Once I got comfortable with the way of thinking, I scaled up the project to integrate and include more things and got creative with the content and style. It was also very helpful to create a flow diagram, to visualize what I wanted to do with my code.

If I had more time, I would definitely dig into refactorization of the code and make it more condense, readable and generic. I would also try to incorporate more types of user input for practice.
