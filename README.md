# Project Name

This is a chatbot that is a digital version of a Magic 8 Ball. It gives random answers to the users questions.

## The problem

I wanted to start with a greeting and personalized welcome message with the username. Then i wanted the chatbot to give randomized answers to the users questions. Only questions that ends with a ? are valid.

I think the code could be structured a bit better, but It's organically arranged based on my work process. I first struggeled with how to make the chatbot start giving the Magic 8 Ball answers AFTER the first greeting. Once I figured that out, it was pretty much done. I wanted to keep it simple, so no more features were added. I'm very happy with the end result and my kids loved asking the chatbot different questions!
