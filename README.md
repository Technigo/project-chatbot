# Project Name

The project objective was to work in pairs and build a chatbot.

## The problem

The goal was to practice our conditional as well as function skills using vanilla javascript. We stuck to basic use of variables, functions and if-statements.

We encountered several bugs relating to innerHTML that took us some time to wrap our heads around but in the end we managed to figure out a way to solve them.

If we had more time we would for example have done some styling. We would also try other forms of inputs, such as radio buttons, images etc, regular buttons, etc.
