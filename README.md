This is a project made during the Technigo Bootcamp.

# Project chat bot
The aim of this project was to build a chat bot using Javascript. The website was already structured with HTML and CSS. We used Javascript to build a chat bot that is answering questions using functions and conditional statements. 

If we would have more time, we would develop the ability to accept several different answers from user.
