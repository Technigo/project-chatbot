# Chatbot Inspirational Quotes, week 4

This weeks assignment was to build a chatbot in javaScript. We got some starter code and a example from Technigo.

## The problem

We did a visual structure of the user flow in Figma (bot questions and user replies). 
We looked at the example code in devTools to try to understand the functions and variables, googled for some answers and articles and looked at youtube videos about js. 
If we would have more time to complete the assignment, we would look further into the CSS and one thing particularily is the picture of the pug that shows in the bot reply when you choose a pick me up in form of a meme.
