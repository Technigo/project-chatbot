# Project Name

Pair project for making a chatbot in JavaScript, using variables, functions, string methods, conditionals and return values.

## The problem

Watched the lessons and googled for understanding how to make it work.
Started by checking out the PizzaBot a little bit for inspiration then headed on to doing the 1-5 iterations.
The plan evolved during the iterations, made some changes along the way.
Tried to add as much variety as we could technology wise regarding the task req. Added images and sound.

If we had more time I think we would've wanted to add more dialogue options and more techniques.
