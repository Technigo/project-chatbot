# Friendbot by Bruna Santos and Anna Thunberg

Create a chatbot with inputs from both the bot and the user.

## The problem

We followed the iterations for the bot, but had some difficulties connecting the bot and the users inputs. We got help during on-call and from our teammates (go lions!) and finally made it work. We made three buttons where the user can choose their mood, and they can choose to see a GIF in the next step. We are happy with the project, as we really struggled this week. If we had more time we would have tried other sorts of buttons for options, and added more questions.
