# Project Name

I created a chatbot where young people can talk about their climate anxiety.

## The problem

I started off by making the chatbot being driven by the SetTimeOut method but then changed my mind, as I wanted to try the nextQuestion and question counter method. 

My intention was to start off the chat with full page and button and animation as the chatbot was typing, but I didn't have time to do that.
