Project Chatbot - by Stephannie Medenilla and Mathilda Karlsson

The assignment was to build a chatbot using mainly JavaScript, and hooking it up with HTML and CSS. The chatbot should be able to store data like the users name and answer with that data in a sentence. The user should be able to choose different answers from buttons and dropdowns and then get a reply from the chatbot depending on which answer was chosen.


The problem
We had some HTML, CSS and Javascript to begin with - and our assignment was to mostly focus on creating the chat-features in JavaScript. We started with reading the excisting code to understand it and how we could build from it. Then we planned what features our chatbot was going to have, and studied how to code them. We learned how to declare and invoke functions, use variables, add eventlisteners and create buttons and dropdown menus using innerHTML. We also learned how to use conditionals and getElementById.

After implementing these tools and techniques we styled the chatbot a bit different than the demo-version using CSS. If we had more time we would extend the chat, making the chatbot a bit more complex and with more questions and replies. We would also use more input-fields if we added more questions, making room for the user to write instead of choosing a yes/no button, for example.
