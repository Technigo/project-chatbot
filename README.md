# Project Name

This week's project is creating a chat bot, in our case a Movie bot who will give you suggestions on movies to watch. Presented as a random movie from a genre chosen by the user.  

## The problem

The biggest issue we encountered was to hide and show buttons in different parts of the integration with the bot. 
With our code and our way to write this bot the best way to solve this was to dynamically hide and show buttons with classes.
 
To get the random movie selector we created four arrays, one for each genre and then created a random number generator to help us pick and present a movie from the array of genres chosen.
