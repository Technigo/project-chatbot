# Project Chatbot

This was our first project using Javascript (never shorten it to java I know now!). The assignment was to create a working chatbot that would communicate and respond to the user's input.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

It was a big leap this week - going from not even knowing what Javascript was to actually writing it. My team quickly turned to each other for help and support and after going through all the material and practices some of us decided to try to figure out the chatbot "problem" together. We figured the best way to understand it was to look at the code of Technigo's chatbot. It felt a bit like cheating but we found that it was the best way to progress because we didn't know where else to start. It was difficult to understand at first but by seeing that code we could step by step understand what each part did. 

This week I have focused on understanding Javascript rather than writing it from scratch. It has been a lot of trial and error changing things, adding and removing parts of code and seeing what happens. If I had more time I would like to practice Javascript by starting really basic and simple. Like making a box that if you click on it it turns another color and then adding more and more functions.
