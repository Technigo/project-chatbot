# Project Name - Technigo Bootcamp Bot Therapist
This is a project that was made during the Technigo Bootcamp spring 2021. The assignment was to build a chat bot. 

## The problem
When we encountered issues we have had help from our project team to solve them. If we ha more time we would have tried to simplify the code and make it more "DRY". We would also have made it more advanced with more steps and more versatile. We would also work more with the styling.
