# Project Name

Pair programming project by Amanda Tilly & Naushin Malik. We have created a chat bot using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## The problem

In order to create this chat bot we tried to use the functional programing approach. We created two functions to handel user input and the questions asked by the bot respectively.

If we had more time we would have tried to have more logical conversation between the bot and the user, a better ending and adding more functions instead of repeating code and last but not least some more styling through CSS.
