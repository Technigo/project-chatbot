# Chatbot

This weeks goal was it to build a simple chatbot to learn how to use functions, and manipulating the DOM. This was a pair project.

## The problem

We sticked with the theme of the pizza project last week and went from there.
Our challenge was to work on the same repository. Therefore, we worked with branches and merge them in the main branch when approved.
