# Project Name

A chatbot designed for ordering food.

## The problem

The main problem was to apply a function for each of the subDishOptions which would lead to the order confirmation.
This was our first week learning JS and the project was overwellming in many senses but it was a good exercice to grasp some of the basic concepts of JS. The DOM their selectors, creating functions, scope functions, eventListeners...

With more time, I would had play more with the style and adding sounds, cleaning the code among many other things.
