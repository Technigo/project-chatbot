# Project Name

This week the task was to build a chatbot. The focus was on practicing the JavaScript parts, but also to hook it up with the HTML. The Chatbot could be about whatever you wanted it to be.

## The problem

I started by looking at the example bot in the Firefox Web Developer tool to get some inspiration, and then I created a FigJam https://www.figma.com/file/nedujRHeXMGKHdE90tt3KP/project-chatbot?node-id=0%3A1&t=Hjz7O2TEWoIoTO1i-1.

Then I started doing the iterations, and I successfully moved past the first two and got stuck immediately on the third. I felt that I was lacking the basics in JS to be able to build what I wanted to build and spent a lot of time reading up and doing simple exercises in CodePen, just to build some confidence to continue. 

I have to admit my defeat with the chatbot: After a week of trying, I still haven't managed to grasp the basics well enough to get past iteration 2. I also struggled quite a lot with self-discipline this week, which I can only blame myself for in the end of the day. 

If I'd had more time, I'd have planned my time better and worked more efficiently. I wish I could have read up on the basics before starting week 1. It'd have saved me a lot of trouble. I feel as though I still barely know how a JS function works. There are a lot of things that I don't know right now, and I can only accept that and move on.

I will continue to work on the chatbot in the coming weeks.
