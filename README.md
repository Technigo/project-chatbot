# Project Name

Travelbot by Ebba Delsol & Jakob Lindstr√∂m.
The project was to build a chatbot with topic of you choice.

## The problem

Our first approach was to decide what the chatbot should be about. We decided that our bot was going to be travelbot that will find a perfect place for you to visit. We were given HTML and CSS styling and focused on JavaScript variables, functions and conditionals.

If we had more time we would have liked to get each continent choice together with a weather choice to lead to a unique place/city. We would have liked to add more conditionals. We would also have liked to add sound on the messages.
