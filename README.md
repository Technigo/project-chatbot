# Project Name

We have created a chatbot to book a haircut/styling for kids only.

The assignment was to use JavaScript functions and conditionals to make a conversation flow between the "user" and the "bot".

## The problem

We've first defined the style and the different steps with Figma.
Next we've handled the first input and created a series of functions to control the flow of the conversation.

We've worked in pair programming using "live share" and also working in our local space,frequently pushing and pulling changes from our Github repository.

We've used google as main tool for our doubts. We've encoutered some small problems to pass the arguments between functions, but we manage to solve it. We've also managed to restart the program when the conversation end, but in order to do this we've deleted one part of the "demo" version in the HTML and added again with JavaScript.
