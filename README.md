# Project Name

Week 4 project was a pair programming project where we were assigned to make a simple chatbot with some requirements as completing 5 iterations and understanding the code together.

## The problem

We started with making a theme-txt (aka a manuscript) laying down what we wanted our bot to do. Following the 5 iterations we approached this assignment using pair programming and the last day of making the bot we used a trello board to lay down clear goals for what we wanted to achieve. 

If we would work more on this project we would like to correct the javascript code and make it easier to read, and avoid reoccuring code snippets that could be condensed into fewer lines of code.

A fun challenge would also be to style the bot more and add even more fun interactions that the bot could do!
