# Project Name


Created a chat bot using js. EventListener and if-iterations. We choose to creat a self-involved doc.robot. 

## The problem

We used one EventListener that we re-iterated to acheive different answers to different questions. 
We created a manuscript that we used as a base when creating the questions and what we wanted the options to be. 

If we had more time we would have created a background image and a footer. We may have double-checked responsiveness more thouroughly as well, now we only used the inspect-tool.
