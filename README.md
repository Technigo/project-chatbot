# Project Name

For this weeks project our assignment was to build a chatbot. The project was done by working in pairs.

## The problem

We started the project by doing a plan for the layout on Figma. We started the coding by forming all the functions in Javascript. We created event listeners and used different type of event handlers, like 'submit' and 'click'. After building all the functions for the chat user and chat bot messages, we refactored the code by using if else conditional statements.
 
We styled our code in css, for example by adding icons to our buttons, creating an animation which starts when the page loads and by adding a background image. In the animation we used @keyframes.

If we would have had more time, we would have tried to refactor the code even more by gathering all the event listeners using the same event under one function. We would also use more user inputs in the replies of the chat bot.
