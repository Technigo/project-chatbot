# Buddys pizzeroa

I made a prolongment to the pizzaproject where the goal was to make a more userfriendly interface  with a chatbot.

## The problem

I looked thorugh the internet and then went through google. If I had more time I would refine som of the elements, like the wording. But it's working even thiugh it's not great.
 I would also add more setTimeOut and maybe a cool sundeffect like a jingle bell.
