# The Chat Bot Project

The brief was to create a simple chat bot using functions, and the DOM.

## The problem

I had trouble many times just getting my code to run. I solved it through using console-log more to trouble shoot, and asking classmates. 
If I had more time, I'd probably add more questions, maybe a music question, triggering a song to play for the user to guess? Also, it would be great to spend more time on styling. I would probably also have used arrays and objects in the functions, if I hade more time, just to get to know those data types better.
