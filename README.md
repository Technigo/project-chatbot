# Project Name

This weekâ€™s project was to build a Chat Bot. The focus has been to practice JavaScript and hook it up with HTML. We have done this project in a pair, Suki Nhung Phan and Mimmi Fordal Uddin.

## The problem

We first made a plan on figma, choosing a theme, and deciding how to structure the bot. Then we did Iteration 1-6 before we started building our project. We planned the bot a little different from the technigo one and made some changes to make it our version. How did we make it different?
 - We decided to customise every single answer with specific question, instead of having same next questions (basing on Technigo's example). 
 
 - In order to keep the code clean and easy to follow through, we created 2 seperate cases (AMBULANCE OR MINOR INJURY),and made seperate if/else statement. 



## View it live

If there were more time, we would add more dialogue options to make it more realistic.
