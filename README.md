# Chat Bot

This project was a colloboration between Jennifer Kurtto and Savannah Hayes. This Medical Chat Bot allows users to chat about medical issues and after taking in their responses direct them to the right healthcare professional. 

## The project

The first step was to plan what we wanted to build, from there we could implment javascript to create an interactive chat bot, and lastly add some styling and sound effects to the chat. 

If we had more time, the next step would be to refactor our code and see if we can make the code more efficient.
