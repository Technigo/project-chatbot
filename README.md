# Project Name

This is a chatbot project that I created in a technigo bootcamp at week 2.
I chose my chatbot for helping a user to know which museum could be interesting for them.

## The problem

There are two js files. Index.js is the first version and script.js is the next.
The reason I created the both is that the first verson was just chacing the next event handler, which made my js file very untidy and is hard to read.
So I made the second version in which I careted an array of objects which stores all the infomation about the conversation.

I had a lot of problems especially with the second version, as I was very confused to create an array to store all the data and make it sure that keeps track of questions one by one. I also had issues with js runtime. For example, I used let global variables in an array of objects, and even they were reasigned, it showed with old values. So I had to redeclear again, just for updating them. I think there could be better options.

I got some ideas from internet and other programmers, and experimented with functions and js runtime problems, and found out each solutions little by little.

----updated 29/09/2023---
I updated with art.json and final.js files.
In art.json file, it contains data about art types, museums, artist, url to museums, and cost. I use it in final.js file and now a user has more choice than an older version. I would like to make this better, such as more data about museums and artists, but I think this is the final version. I would make another project to do the similar but with more data version.
