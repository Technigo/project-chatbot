# Project Name

This week, we were tasked with creating a chatbot. Since we wanted the chatbot to work "on it's own", like an actual robot, we decided to create a math robot, that delivered endless math problems to the user. 

## The problem

We only had a couple of days where we all could work together, but since we had great teamwork, it worked really well even if we didn't have that much time. We struggled a bit with the scopes and functions, but once we got the hang of it it went really smooth for all of us. We worked really well together and used each other's knowledge to make a great product.
