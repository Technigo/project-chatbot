# HANNAH & NICLAS' CHATBOT

For this assignment, we created a chatbot that dispenses (bad) jokes in an interactive conversation with the user. The bot dispenses a new joke at the user's
request until it has fully exhausted its array of jokes. 

## The problem

As the learning goal for this assignment was to become familiarised with JS functions and arrays, we used both extensively to create the bot. We deecided
early on that a joke-dispensing chatbot would allow us to complete the learning objectives of the assignment. 

If we had more time, we could have added additional functions to make the conversation flow more interactive, such as setting up multiple joke arrays with different
types of jokes that the user could select from instead of just g-rated 'dad jokes'.
