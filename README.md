# Ice Cream Bot
The assignment was to build a chatbot and we decided to make one for an imaginary Ice Cream Shop.
The focus was to practice JavaScript function and DOM manipulation.

## The problem
First we started bouncing around ideas about what kind of chatbot we wanted to build. When we decided on the Ice Cream Shop we started to think about the questions and the chat "flow", what input types we wanted for every question etc.

The most challenging parts was probably to get rather "small" things to work the way we wanted them to. For example getting the checked checkboxes in to the customerOrder object and making the number input behave like we wanted it to.

We used a for-loop and if/else statement to solve the checkbox problem and we used another if/else for the object method presentOrder. We also got a lot of practice in HTML forms, input types and the way they behave etc.

We started off coding a lot together but split up some of the tasks after a while. We had some troubles with GitHub since one of us was working in the main branch and another in their own branch etc. A little stressful, but in the end it was nice the get to know git/github a little bit better.

If we had more time we would probably split up the functions a little more. For example, not just separating the bot questions from the user replies, but also keeping the event listeners separated from the reply functions.
