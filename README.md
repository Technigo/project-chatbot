# Project Chatbot

A simple chatbot that interacts with the user and guides them through a fun, personalized conversation.

## The problem

The problem was approached by breaking down the interaction flow into distinct steps: greeting the user, capturing inputs, and generating responses based on the input. Vanilla JavaScript was used for DOM manipulation and event handling, such as form submission. The UI was dynamically updated. Given more time, additional conversation options and design improvements would be implemented to enhance user experience.
