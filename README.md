# Project Name

The assignment was to build a chatbot using JavaScript functions and conditional statements. The project required working together in a pair to complete all project iterations.

Stretch goals that we reached include:
- Changing the styling
- Adding additional form elements
- Refactoring the code to learn more about different approaches with functions

The project was done as pair programming in collaboration with Ã…sa Sieurin.

## The problem

More coming soon.
