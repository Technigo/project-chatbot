# Project Name

For the project week #5 we had to create a chatbot that can interact with users, ask questions, display messages, and respond with precision, using mostly JS.

 
## The problem

I was again stick to the steps that we go, and I readed carefully the predeterminated comments that were added to the file, and trying out what was already there helped me to understand a bit more each function. 

I had problems setting the time with setTimeout for the second message, and I still trying to understand what happened there, if I had more time I would fix it to make it work in a smoother way. 

This time I repeated a few times some of the videos in the weekly material for a deeper understanding, I tried to watch some youtube videos in my native language and english to have more clear the concepts, and as usual I got a some help from chatgpt and w3school and stack overflow.
