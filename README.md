## The problem

I had the flu so this week was extra hard since I couldnt catch up as normal. Hopefully I made it somehow. Just went trough all material and took it step by step. Used the Java Script we learned. If I had more time, I would have studied more, more repetition to understand what I was doing, because I am not really at the moment. Keeping it basic to even be able to hand in anyting.
