# Project Name

The project was to create a chatbot that interacts with the user using DOM, functions and event listeners

## The problem

I tackled the project by creating a scenario for how the conversation would flow and then tried to set up functions for each step of the conversation.

If there had been more time I would have tried to get the chatbot to fetch real weather data. The chatbot does not show a message for invalid input when typing in something else than the suggested occasions, which I would add if I had more time for the project, alternatively using buttons for the options as well.
