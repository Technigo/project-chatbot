# Technigo project: Build a Chat bot

The assignment was to create a chat bot with Javascript. We used variables, string methods, conditional statements and basic functions that take arguments and return values.

This project was our first project made with pair programming. We took turns coding in Visual Studio Code using Live Share.

## The problem

We could implement DOM selectors, variables, string methods, functions and event listeners according to the requirements of the project. We implemented even a conditional statement but the most challenging part was to set the delay times for all chat bubbles once all interactions and messages were se, still we managed to implement only a couple of them. Probably the structure of the code could be better as well.

We had a good collaboration despite the challenge of having different schedules and Live Share not working properly. We could code together and when not we resolved it by sharing the files and having a good communication making sure goals and progress were being understood by both of us.

Overall we are very satisfied with what we achieve with this project.
