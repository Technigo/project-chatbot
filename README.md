# Project Name

The assignment is to create a chat bot. I chose to create a chat bot for a restaurant where you can order food. 

## The problem
The problems I had was to get the buttons and options right and also to understand the flow of the functions.
Stack overflow helped me alot with this project and I'm happy that I'm not alone. 
If I had more time I would include alternatives for drinks as well and experiment with sounds on submit.
