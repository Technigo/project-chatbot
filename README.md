# Project Name

This is a chatbot project that I created in a technigo bootcamp at week 2.
I chose my chatbot for helping a user to know which museum in europe could be interesting for them. There are three type of art genre choice and each genre has three artist to choose from.
I would like to extend more choices and make it more complicated to find out really the best museum for the user. But it will be the next step.

## The problem

There are two js files. Index.js is the first version and script.js is the next.
The reason I created the both is that the first verson was just chacing the next event handler, which made my js file very untidy and is hard to read.
So I made the second version in which I careted an array of objects which stores all the infomation about the conversation.

I had a lot of problems especially with the second version, as I was very confused to create an array to store all the data and make it sure that keeps track of questions one by one. I also had issues with js runtime. For example, I used let global variables in an array of objects, and even they were reasigned, it showed with old values. So I had to redeclear again, just for updating them. I think there could be better options.

I got some ideas from internet and other programmers, and experimented with functions and js runtime problems, and found out each solutions little by little.
