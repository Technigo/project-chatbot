Made a chatbot that is a time machine and redirect you to videos from the day you select using Javascript.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

It was really hard to get started and know where and how to start. But I decided to look at other projects code and tweak it so that it suited my needs. I focsed only on the Javascript and after I figured out how to get the bot and user to communicate I started to think about what they should communicate. With more time I would work more on the styling and try to get the video to show up in a pop up/light box instead of redirecting you to a new site. Also I didn't figure out how to delay a single message.
