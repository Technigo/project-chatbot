I have to admit this is not an easy assignment for me considering this is only the third week of the program. I felt like I didn't know enough to know what to do. However, it also pushed me to take a big leap of faith for myself that I can do it. 

Instead of investing time to style or come up a better idea for the chat bot, I spent a lot of time to think about how to simplyfy the code. Yet, I am not fully satisfied with the outcome and think I could do better to declare global variables. There are too many nested functions which confused myself.

In conclusion, I think it's a good challenge and I really learn a lot!
This gonna be a project that I will definitely come back to improve.



## The problem

I had some problems with the flow and the sequence of the chat in the beginning, but found some solutions with chat GPT and googling. 

Like I said previously, my code got complicated when I had to reuse some local variables. The chatbot works, but would like to clean up the code in the future.
