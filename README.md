# Project Chatbot

This is our first paired-programming project.
Sara and I decided to build a snow bot that helps potential students pick the right ski course using
basic javaScript.

Users should be able to :
- enter name and age
- If users are younger than 25 years old, the chat will end and the page will refresh.
- If users are 26 years old or older, the chat will proceed to the next question.
