Project Name: Movie chatbot

The purpose of this project was to create an interactive chatbot that engages users in a conversational flow. The chatbot greets the user, allows them to pick a movie genre, select their age group, and then suggests appropriate movies based on their choices.

## The problem

Functionality & Hierarchy: 
One of the primary challenges was creating functions that worked correctly while maintaining the proper structure of the website. Organizing the site hierarchically to ensure the right values and variables were filled out, and functions were called properly, was difficult.

Variable Scope: 
Another challenge was understanding where to place variables and values to ensure they were accessible at the right times. I struggled with ensuring that variables were in the correct scope so they could be used within functions. I solved this by restructuring my code and moving variables to the global scope when necessary, ensuring they were introduced before being called in functions. 

Event Listeners: 
Setting up event listeners properly was tricky. Ensuring that they triggered the correct actions at the right time required careful structuring. I tested different ways of implementing event listeners, it took some time to learn how to ensure they correctly triggered the right functions. 

I used console.log extensively throughout the project to trace the flow of my code and see where issues were occurring. This helped me a lot with identifying bugs.

If I had more time:
I would focus on cleaning up the structure of the code to make it shorter and more efficient. Right now, there is a lot of repeated code that I think could be simplified. For example, I believe there are opportunities to combine similar functions so that one function could handle multiple tasks instead of writing the same type of logic repeatedly.

Fixing the Final Error: I encountered a TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'value') error when the user clicks "Yes" or "No" at the end of the flow. I couldn't solve this issue in the given time, but with more time, I would focus on fixing this error, possibly by ensuring that the selected movie value is properly stored and accessible when the confirmation step is triggered.
