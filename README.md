# Week 4: chatbot

We had this week to build a chat-bot in order to practice JavaScript and pair-programming.

## The problem

We started by planning the main questions to figure out the flow of our chat-bot. For the coding we had 5 iterations to finish and we took turn on being the driver vs navigator. We managed to use several conditionals. We tried different approaches by ourselves but we could have been better at using the channels for help.  

If we had more time, we would maybe restructure our JavaScript file in a more efficient way since we repeat ourselves a little bit. The next weeks will help us to have a better understanding of JavaScript and to feel more comfortable of moving the code around.
