# Project Chatbot

Our task was to create a chatbot using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## The problem

We started by following the iterations given to us in the instructions, adding small pieces of code one by one. As the Javascript part was getting closer to being finished, we started working on the styling.

If we had more time, we would have wanted to find a better way to handle the input from the user in a more efficient way, i.e. using less lines of code. We would also have liked to add sound effects.

### Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

- [Prettier](https://www.prettier.io/) for code linting
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deployment
