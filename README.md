### **The challenge**

✓ How to use variables in JavaScript.
✓ How to use conditionals in JavaScript.
✓ Know some string methods to modify strings.
✓ Understand control flow and the use of conditional statements.
✓ How to use functions in JavaScript
✓ Different datatypes

## **My process**

A fun little project that I had a blast building.
I started with deciding the dialogue flow and options of the bot, deciding that it would fit the theme of the chat app to have a storyteller at the start and end of the dialogue.

Then my focus was on the javascript. This was a great practice of the setTimeout function (that I intend to refactor with promises). Also, a lot of practice with the DOM, adding content to the page.

Over to the CSS, no big add-ons on the boilerplate given to us, but with my personal twist on it.
