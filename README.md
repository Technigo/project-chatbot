# Project Name

Simple chat-bot with multiple-choice questions. Tracking question number for launching next question. Also tracking score presented at end of quiz.

## The problem
I started of making the basic functions and order work in a liniar model. When that was set up, I rewrote the code to launch next question with an if/else-statement.
