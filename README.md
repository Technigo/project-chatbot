<h1>Pizza bot 👾</h1>


The goal was to make a text-based chatbot with a partner, in the pair-programming modality. This project was done with @honkoan.

<h2>Learning objectives</h2> 🔍
<ul>
<li>Using variables in JavaScript.</li>

<li>Know how to use string methods to modify strings.</li>

<li>Understand control flow & the use of conditionals statements.</li>

<li>Be able to write basic functions which take arguments and return values.</li>

<li>Connect the JavaScript to show visual feedback in the HTML.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The problem☕</h2>

We struggled with the logical order of the function and the implementation of the schema that we had planned. our strategy was to stick to the code that we could understand and not try more advanced things that we didn't know how to make work. If we had more time, we would add more options using conditionals, try to fix the responses timing and the overall styling.
