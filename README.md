# MirelaÂ´s Chatbot

Replace this readme with your own information about your project.

Start by briefly describing the assignment in a sentence or two. Keep it short and to the point.

## The problem

## Step 1: 
//Console.log
Did not manage to use the console.log directly in the browser - got errors. It works in the code, however I am not sure if I have fully understood the benefits and possibilities of the console.log. So I decided to use it to mirror the chatlog, in order to show that I understand how it should be coded, however not necessarily how it should be used and why.

//Start Chat:
I wanted to start the chat throught a button, but found this too complicated and time consuming. I hope we can learn this at a later point.
