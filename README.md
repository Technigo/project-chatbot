# Project Name

Week 1 project was to create a chatbot. The goal was to practice Javascript and the key takeaways from week 1 on the boot camp with Technigo.

## The problem

I had a hard time this week and spent way too much time on trying to figure JS out, instead of building the project itself. Ended up with a "half-ready" chatbot that isn't working after question 1 - so I know I'll have a change request on this one.

Right now I can't figure this out on my own so I'll need help solving the problem.

## View it live

I will deploy it on Netlify - you ca go to my Netlify here: https://app.netlify.com/sites/ylvakarlsson/overview (it will be up soon - after I've commited this to my GitHub.)
I will fic the errors with this weeks project but I'll need help - have reached out to my classmates about it.
