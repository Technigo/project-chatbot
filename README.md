# Project Name

The assignment was to create a chatbot interface using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

My chatbot is called The GameBot. It starts with asking for the users name and then puts out three questions for the user to answer. The js-code includes functions and conditional statements. I also used the DOM to add come HTML code inside of the js-file. 

## The problem

The biggest problem was to get started. I used Technigo material to understand how to use functions and the DOM. After that I used material on YouTube and other websites to get a deeper understanding of the different steps. I a also took some help from my team members and looked att their code to progress. 

If I had more time i would try out adding a dropdown. I did add one at first but couldn't quite figure out how to use them in the bot.
