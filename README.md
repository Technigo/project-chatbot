# Project Name
This project is part of Technigo boot camp, week 4. The goal was to create a simple chat bot. 

## The problem

The biggest challenge for us was to understand javascript and it's fundamental concepts. We solved it with allowing ourselves to try and make mistakes, learning by doing. In the end we wanted to keep it simple and to the point, and focused on understanding the javascript we needed to use for this project. If we had more time we would want to make the conversation smoother with better utilising setTimeout, as well as adding more fun functions in javascript.
