# Paws & Hooves Haven chatbot

The assignment was to build a functional chatbot interface by using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The chatbot should be interactive and responsive.

We made a chatbot for an animal shelter where the user can adopt either a cat, a dog or a horse.

## The problem

We started looking at and discussing the already existing code, as well the technical material provided by Technigo. We then looked at other resources like YouTube videos, StackOwerflow and projects done by previous students at Technigo.

Using last week's assignment as a framework, we played around with the code until we understood what was going on and how we could achieve our goals. Once we made the code skeleton in JavaScript, we then decided what theme our bot sohuld have and how it should be designed.

If we had had more time we would have tried out the advanced stretch goals.
