# Project Name

Second project for the Technigo web development bootcamp. A simple interactive chatbot made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

## The problem

The chatbot had a starter code with a conditional statement answering to whether it was the bot or the user typing. I approached to problem by adding more inputs and messages from the bot. I finished the project by adding a conditional statement to the output value of what month the user picked in the month-input, and making the website responsive.
