# Project chatbot

My task was to develop an interactive chatbot in JavaScript where the user can communicate with the bot by entering their name and responding to various questions. I was to build upon the existing code by handling user inputs, controlling the flow of the conversation, and adding new features and effects such as conditional statements, different input types, and potentially sound.

## The problem

To approach the problem, I started by carefully reading through the existing code (and watched Jennie's video) to understand how the chatbot was structured and which functions were already in place. I identified the key areas where I needed to add new functionality, such as handling user input, managing the conversation flow, and dynamically updating the content on the page.

I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as the main technologies for this project. I utilized JavaScript to handle user interactions, create functions for different conversation stages, and control the timing of messages using setTimeout. In addition, I employed CSS to style the chat interface and make it visually appealing, and HTML to structure the content on the page.

For planning, I outlined the conversation flow and identified key questions and answers to include. I then broke down the development into smaller tasks, such as creating event listeners for user inputs, implementing functions to handle specific stages of the conversation, and testing each step to ensure it worked correctly.

If I had more time, I would further enhance the chatbot by adding more diverse response types, such as drop-down menus or clickable options, implementing additional sound effects, and optimizing the code to make it more scalable and efficient.
