- testing every part in browser and in case of problems with console.log and with a validator
- modifying some html and css
- consulting my own notes regarding usage of comandos and other resources

### Built with

- vanilla JS
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- editor: visual studio code

### What I learned 

How to manipulate the DOM with vanilla JS, catching and processing events, how to manipulate the time of execution of functions, how to conduct the flow of executions.

### Continued development

Writing shorter and more efficient code, creating more reusable code snippets.

### Useful resources
